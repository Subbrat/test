    ABSTRACT . 
Background: Diabetes and its complications, primarily of type 2, are worsening as 
we write because of rapid cultural changes, an ageing population, increasing 
urbanization, dietary lifestyles, and behavioral patterns without adequate prevention 
and control measures, compelling Indian government to be vigilant as thousands of 
Indians face the risk of premature death.
Objective: the purpose of this study is to investigate the association between diabetes 
management and demographic variables in a large patient population.
Methods: Several electronic databases, including NCD Portal, International Diabetes 
Federation, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and The National 
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), were used to conduct a systematic 
search for relevant studies published between January 2016 and December 2022.
Results: In India, the prevalence of diabetes was 9.2% (men: 8.8%, women: 9.6%), 
and the prevalence of prediabetes was 13.3%. During 2014-2015, the ICMR INDIAB 
Study was conducted in 15 Indian states and union territories. The Andaman and 
Nicobar Islands had the highest prevalence (26 percent among men and 14.5 percent 
among women), whereas Haryana and Bihar had the lowest prevalence (8.2 percent 
for men and 6.1 percent for female, respectively).
Conclusion: The findings of this study have the potential to inform healthcare 
professionals as well as policymakers about ways to improve the management of 
diabetes.

  INTRODUCTION
Millions of people around the globe suffer from diabetes, a 
chronic metabolic disorder. It is defined by high blood sugar 
levels brought on by either an inability to produce insulin or 
an increased sensitivity to it. Monitoring blood glucose 
levels, eating a nutritious diet, and taking medications as 
directed are all part of managing diabetes. Effective 
management, however, can be difficult for patients due to a 
variety of variables, including socioeconomic position, 
cultural beliefs, and demographic traits.
This study aims to investigate the connection between 
demographic variables and the management of diabetes in a 
sizable patient group. In order to accomplish this, we 
conducted an analysis of information gathered from 
electronic health records (EHRs) of diabetes patients from 
reputable sources and official websites to gain a better 
understanding of the current state of diabetes in India and 
around the globe.
The results of this research may help healthcare professionals 
and policymakers learn how to better manage diabetes in a 
variety of patient populations. Providers can better meet the 
needs of individual patients by customizing treatment plans 
by being aware of the variables that affect diabetes 
management results. Furthermore, pinpointing inequalities in 
diabetes management can help interventions promote health 
equity and lessen inequalities.

  METHODS
Data search strategy:
Using multiple electronic databases, including NCD Portal, 
International Diabetes Federation, Centre for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), and The National Centre for Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI), a systematic search was conducted to identify 
relevant studies published between January 2016 and December 
2022. Included in the search terms were "diabetes", 
"demographics", "management", "outcomes", and "data analysis".
..
Study selection criteria: 
Included studies met the following criteria: (1) they examined the 
association between demographic factors and diabetes management 
outcomes; (2) they included a quantitative data analysis; (3) they 
included adult patients with diabetes; (4) they were published in 
English; and (5) they appeared in all peer-reviewed journals to 
which the authors from all around the world contributed to.
.
Synthesis of results:
To summarise the findings of the included studies, a narrative 
synthesis of results was performed. Microsoft Excel was used to 
analyse the collected data, and Adobe Illustrator was used to create 
graphics to visually represent the results and make them 
presentable.
.
Limitations: 
This study's reliance on EHR data, which may contain errors or 
missing information, is a limitation. In addition, the study was 
conducted using only online data, so it is not very comprehensive. 
As the study was observational, causality between demographic 
factors and diabetes management outcomes cannot be established.

    Country-wise representation of various data related to diabetes









537 million 20-79-year-olds have diabetes, 1 in 10. By 2030, 643 million (1 in 9 adults) will have diabetes, and by 2045, 784 million (1 in 8 adults). 81% of diabetics live in low- and middle-income countries. Diabetes killed 6.7 million people in 2021—one every five seconds. Diabetes mortality is low in under-30s but rises after 30. Undiagnosed diabetes affects 44% of adults (240 million). Nearly 90% live in low- and middle-income countries. In 2021, diabetes cost USD 966 billion. The 15-year increase is 316 percent. 541 million adults—1 in 10—have impaired glucose tolerance, putting them at high risk of type 2 diabetes. In the 10 countries with the most diabetic adults, 68% live. Diabetes risk factors include obesity, inactivity, diet, family history, and ethnicity.
According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Atlas, 11% of people aged 20–79 in the US have diabetes. This league table includes EU countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Israel, Andorra, Norway, Switzerland, and the U.S. The U.S., with almost 30 million diabetics, has two thirds the number of cases of all 37 developed nations combined (46 million). Singapore was a close second to the U.S. (10.5 percent), followed by Malta (10 percent), Portugal (10 percent), and Cyprus (9.5 percent). Canada, the World Diabetes Congress host, ranks 12th with 7%.
The U.S. leads developed nation alliances but ranks 60th globally. Tokelau (30%) leads the global league, followed by Nauru (24%), Mauritius (22%), the Cook Islands (21%), and the Marshall Islands (21%). (21 percent). Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait are top ten. China and India have the most diabetics (110 million and 69 million, respectively), but they rank 78th and 76th in prevalence, respectively.
As we write, diabetes and its complications, mostly type 2, are worsening due to rapid cultural changes, an ageing population,

increasing urbanization, dietary lifestyles, and behavioral patterns without prevention and control, putting thousands of Africans at risk of early death. African governments must beware. Poor education and illiteracy, low socioeconomic status, and lack of health care make diabetes research translation in Sub-Saharan Africa uncertain, and the world will witness the epidemic's catastrophic potential. The World Diabetes Foundation and literature have highlighted Mali, Mozambique, and Zambia. The environment in South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria—some of the continent's most developed—can indicate how people are coping. Medical statistics showed that Africa's diabetes incidence rate was 1.4 percent or less from 1959 to the mid-1980s, except for South Africa, where it was 3.6 percent in 2001. Diabetes was estimated to affect 7.1 million Africans in 2000 and 18.6 million by 2030. >40% of diabetics were undiagnosed here.
Diabetes mellitus was 1–6% among Africans, 10–13% among Caribbeans of African descent, and 12–15% among African Americans, which is high. African whites have had rates between 6 and 10 percent, like European whites. Genetic predisposition, along with environmental factors, diet, lifestyle (inactivity), and residence, may be a major factor in the racial and ethnic diabetes puzzle. Diabetes, known as the "disease of opulence" in Africa, is more common among the wealthy and powerful and in urban areas where people are less active and eat a diet high in saturated fats and refined carbohydrates.




Percentage of Diabetes Death occurring under 70 years
The percentage of global diabetes-related deaths that occur in people younger than 70 is useful for gauging the impact of the disease on younger populations and locating potential sites for intervention.
According to the International Diabetes Federation, diabetes will be the direct cause of death for an estimated 4.2 million people worldwide in 2019. About 1.1 million people died before they turned 70 years old from complications related to diabetes.
However, the age distribution of diabetes-related deaths varies greatly across regions. In high-income countries, only about 14% of diabetes-related deaths occur in people younger than 70 years old. In contrast, up to 60% of diabetes-related deaths occur in people under the age of 70 in low and middle-income countries.
This disparity in diabetes-related mortality emphasizes the significance of successful diabetes prevention and management strategies, especially in low- and middle-income nations where resources and access to healthcare may be restricted. Moreover, initiatives to encourage healthy lifestyle choices and enhance diabetes education may be crucial in lowering the burden of diabetes-related deaths, especially in younger populations. 













In 1991, India's economy was liberalised, and as a result, the country's social and economic climate shifted dramatically. Increased prosperity among the population led to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of obesity in India. Large quantities of high-energy foods high in carbohydrates, fat, and calories were consumed. Aside from a sharp rise in diabetes cases, this factor also contributed to higher rates of obesity, hypertension, and even cancer.
 Recent studies show that in metropolitan areas like Chennai and Delhi, 22–24 percent of the adult population aged 20–59 suffers from diabetes. Over 40% of the population over the age of 55 has diabetes, and another 35% have prediabetes, in these cities. Rural areas, especially in states like Bihar and Jharkhand, have a comparatively low prevalence of diabetes. Even in less urbanised parts of the South, the rate of diabetes diagnosis is now between 14% and 18%. It's possible that rural areas, like Kerala, have a higher rate of diabetes than urban areas.
Rising diabetes rates have been a major health concern in India recently. The estimated 32 million people who had diabetes in 2000 rose to 41 million in 2007 and 62 million in 2011. Over 73% of the Indian population had diabetes by 2017. By 2045, an estimated 134 million Indians will have the disease.



















Prevalence of Diabetes in Different age groups in Urban and rural India
In Figure 3A, we see the overall prevalence of diabetes broken down by age group for both urban and rural areas and for men and women. Men were more likely than women to have diabetes between the ages of 35 and 65; however, women had a slight advantage after age 65. Urban areas had a significantly higher diabetes prevalence than rural areas, and this was true across all age groups. People between the ages of 25 and 34 were the first to be diagnosed with diabetes in both urban and rural areas. Prediabetes was also more common in urban areas among all age groups, with the exception of those aged 65 and up, who show the opposite trend. There was no discernible difference between males and females. For illustration , refer Figure 3B.






















Weighted prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in 15 states/Union territory of India - the ICMR INDIAB Study
According to the National Family Health Survey, four surveys were conducted in 15 Indian states/union territories in 2014-2015, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands had the highest prevalence of diabetes (26 and 14.5 percent among men and women, respectively). The lowest prevalence was in Haryana and Bihar, with 8.2 and 6.1 percent, respectively. Urban areas had a higher incidence rate than rural ones. Tamil Nadu's urban areas saw a rise in diabetes prevalence from 18.6 percent in 2006 to 21.9 percent in 2016, while the prevalence also rose in smaller towns from 16.4 percent to 20.3 percent and in peri-urban villages from 16.4 percent to 20.3 percent, as reported in the study Secular Trends in Diabetes in India.











Contribution Of Different Risk Factors of Diabetes
Even though economic, developmental, epidemiological, and demographic circumstances vary greatly from country to country, the global burden of diabetes mellitus, one of the leading chronic non-communicable diseases, is rising at an alarming rate of 43 percent per year. Several serious micro- and macro- vascular complications are more common in people with diabetes, resulting in increased medical expenses, diminished quality of life, and premature death. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), 463 million adults have diabetes in 2019, and that number is expected to rise to 700 million by 2045. Every six seconds, someone dies from complications of diabetes, and each year, the disease claims the lives of five million people around the world, most of whom live in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). From 88 million in 2019 to 153 million in 2045, a 74% increase in diabetes cases is predicted for countries in Southeast Asia over the next two decades. High body mass index was identified as the primary risk factor contributing to 41.2% of type 2 diabetes mortality in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, followed by ambient particulate matter pollution risk factors (18.0% of type 2 diabetes-relevant deaths) and a diet low in whole grains (11.8% of type 2 diabetes-relevant deaths) (accounting for 16.5 percent of type 2 diabetes-relevant deaths).
In a developing country, multilevel mixed-effects were used to age-normalize numerical increases in diabetes and prediabetes and to identify risk factors. Diabetes affected 9.2% of the population in Bangladesh (men 8.8%, women 9.6%), and 13.3% of the population had prediabetes (men: 13.0 percent, women: 13.6 percent). Diabetic prevalence was found to be higher in females, the elderly, those with central obesity, and those living in urban areas. Only 30.4% of those diagnosed with diabetes could say they had their condition under control, while 61.5% said they were unaware of this environment.
Factors allied with an increased vogue for having diabetes were increasing age, gender, overweight, hypertension, being in the highest wealth quintile, and living in the Dhaka division. Diabetes and prediabetes upset a substantial proportion (over one-quarter) of the Bangladeshi adult population. Continuing surveillance and effective prevention and control measures, focusing on obesity reduction and hypertension management, are urgently needed.
Lack of access to effective treatment for type 2 diabetes is a major contributor to disease-related mortality and disability in low-income regions of the world. Intensive blood glucose control was used in many countries with few resources, leading to an unexpected increase in the risk of hypoglycemia and possible death. Only a few high-income nations account for 80 percent of global spending and investment on diabetes care. Half of the estimated $232 billion spent on diabetes care in 2007 occurred in the United States, while another quarter occurred in Europe, totaling $64 billion. Conversely, India, home to the world's largest diabetic population, spent only 0.9%. Just 0.3% of global spending came from African nations.
DISCUSSION
Diabetes is one of the most easily measured NCDs. Statistics on diabetes prevalence are useful for predicting the spread of other chronic diseases. About 537 million adults (20-79) have diabetes; this represents about 10% of the adult population. By 2030, this figure is expected to reach 643 million, and by 2045, it will reach 783 million. More than eight out of every ten adults who have diabetes call a low- or middle-income country home. One person dies every five seconds in the year 2021 due to diabetes.
Prior to the last couple of decades, infectious diseases such as typhoid, cholera, malaria, dengue fever, and tuberculosis were the leading causes of death in India and across the world. The last twenty to thirty years have seen significant changes in this regard in India. Slowly at first, the rates of transmission of infectious diseases began to fall. Diseases that can be spread from person to person, such as the flu, have been rapidly supplanted by those that cannot be spread between people: NCDs like diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart disease, stroke, and cancer.
Over half of all deaths in India from NCDs in 1991 occurred in just one state, Kerala, according to the Global Burden of Diseases India Survey. More than half of all deaths in each of India's 36 states and union territories in 2016 were attributable to NCDs, with some states, like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, seeing rates of up to 75%.
The prevalence of diabetes in India was estimated to be 2% in urban areas and 1% in rural areas based on studies conducted in the early 1970s by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). At the time, diabetes was thought to be primarily a condition of migrating Indians because Indians living in the United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Fiji, and Mauritius had double-digit rates of diabetes, significantly higher even when compared to the local host population, which could be White, Black, Chinese, or any other ethnic group. However, in 1991, India's economy opened, and the country's social and economic climate changed rapidly. As people in India became more financially secure, they began to gain weight at alarming rates, leading to a sharp increase in the prevalence of diabetes.
The good news is that prevention of diabetes is possible. As diabetes is an asymptomatic disease, one has to start screening early, particularly in high-risk groups. To lower the chance of acquiring diabetes, regardless of age, it is critical to take preventive steps and maintain a healthy lifestyle. It is important to do regular exercise, have a well-balanced diet, and keep a healthy weight to help prevent or manage diabetes.
